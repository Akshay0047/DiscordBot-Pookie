# Pookie - A Discord Bot

Pookie is a Discord bot that provides multiple functionalities, including AI chat, music playback, reminders, polls, and welcome messages. It is built using Discord.py and follows a modular cog-based structure for maintainability and extensibility.

## Features
- **AI Chat**: Chat with Gemini AI using `pook q`.
- **Music Player**: Play, pause, resume, skip, and queue songs.
- **Reminders**: Set, list, delete, and modify reminders.
- **Polls**: Create polls and view poll results.
- **Welcome Messages**: Sends a DM or channel message to new members.
- **Modular Cogs**: Easy-to-maintain and extend functionality.

### `NOTE`:
If I had more time to improve Pookie, I would focus on:

  Make Gemini AI remember previous messages in a conversation for better replies.

  Allow server admins to tweak the AIâ€™s personality and response style.

  Allow users to self-assign roles via reactions

  Detect and delete spam or inappropriate messages

  Scale across multiple servers without performance drops

  Translate AI and command responses into different languages.
